                Shakib not available for second Test against South Africa: BCB chief selector
              </h3>
              <p>
                Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan will not be available for the second Test against South Africa, BCB's chief selector confirmed on Friday (April 1).

                Shakib had to return home from South Africa after the third ODI due to a family emergency. BCB, however, didn't rule him out of the Test series as they had hoped that he would be available for the series-concluding second Test against South Africa.

                Shakib is understood to be flying over to the USA on Friday. ''He (Shakib) is not available for the second Test against South Africa,'' said Minhajul Abedin to Cricbuzz. ''He informed us that he will be going to the USA as he needs to set up his family there,'' he added.

              <p>
                Many cricketminded South Africans - and surely also Bangladesh's more serious, less blindly nationalistic supporters - would want to tell Mominul Haque's team something of that sort as they prepare for the second Test at St George's Park. If the visitors don't pull themselves out of their damaging downward spiral of negativity about matters they cannot change, what started as their most successful tour of South Africa could end in ignominy.

                BCB to lodge official complaint to ICC on umpiring
              </h3>
              <p>
                Bangladesh Cricket Board said on Monday that they will lodge an official complaint to International Cricket Council about South Africa's umpiring at Kingsmead after the ongoing series.

                Several decisions went against the host in the two-match Test series opener while tourist skipper Mominul Haque insisted after the game that they were a victimof severe sledging.

                According to players of the touring camp and BCB officials, the umpiring of Adrian Thomas Holdstock and his senior partner Marais Erasmus was certainly not up to the mark.
